# library
A collection of the papers, conference talks, articles, blog posts, interesting Twitter threads, HN/reddit comments on all topics I find interesting. 

If you wish to add a new category, please run the `init-repo` script which will set up a skeleton directory in the standard structure. 

Each directory has three sub-directories - Articles, Papers and Talks. A markdown file links to all papers/talks/articles.

The `add-paper` script will add a paper to a directory given a URL. I plan to automate more of this process as I find more time.
